Title: Data Entry Namespaces

## Simple Summary

Defines a standard syntax to represent namespaces in data entries.

## Abstract

This SEP provides a standard way to represent
[namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) into Stellar accounts
data entries, and guidelines about how to parse them and handle edge-cases.

## Motivation

As a generic mechanism to store key/value pairs on the ledger, data entries
accept a very wide range of use cases. If each actor uses it following its
syntax, it will lead to a confusing experience and ultimately to name conflicts.

Introducing namespaces allow to hierarchize and organize data, in such a way
that sorting the key/value entries will result in a readable output even when
using them for various purpose on the same account. It also helps to prevent
names clash.

This SEP provides guidelines for other SEPs, external applications as well as
libraries or utilities dealing with data entries.

## Specification

Namespace hierarchy is encoded in the key using one or more terms separated by
dots. Terms are made of lowercase letters, underscore and numbers and mustn't
start with a number.

**Examples**

```
config.two_factor
config.multisig.server
config.multisig.network
config.multisig.key
profile.name
profile.language
wallet.btc
wallet.eth
```

* **Term REGEXP:** `[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*`
* **Key REGEXP:** `[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*(\.[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*)*`

When parsing the data tree in a given programming language, keys that don't
respect this syntax must be ignored and valid entries must be hierarchized in
an adequate data structure. If a term is used both as an identifier and a
namespace, a warning must be thrown by the parser and the identifier value
must be ignored.


**Example: same data tree in JSON**

```js
{
  config: {
    two_factor: ...,
    multisig: {
      server: ...,
      network: ...,
      key: ...
    }
  },
  profile: {
    name: ...,
    language: ...
  },
  wallet: {
    btc: ...,
    eth: ...
  }
}
```


## Rationale

**Syntax**

The namespace syntax had to be familiar, and terms have to be written in a way
that is valid across a broad range of programming languages.

This SEP uses JavaScript syntax because it is a well-known language. It is also
familiar to anybody using JSON, which is a format widely used to pass data, and
the one already used by horizon API.

Parsing the data tree must lead to the same namespace/key/value structure
regardless of the programming language being used. This is the reason why term
syntax must be restricted, as unusual characters could lead to difficulties or
errors. The lowercase restriction is meant to prevent a different data tree
interpretation between case-sensitive and case-insensitive languages.

**Identifier/namespace conflict**

This conflict happens when a term is used both as an identifier and a namespace,
such as:

```
config.multisig = 1234
config.multisig.server = https://myserver.org
```

This situation is can be hard or impossible to translate into a data structure,
depending on the language.

There are three ways to solve it:

* Ignore all related definitions
* Ignore the identifier definition
* Ignore the definitions under that namespace

While no solution is ideal, the last one seems better as at least it prevents
the shortcutting of a whole branch.

## Backwards Compatibility

This SEP doesn't introduce incompatibilities: the keys that are not formatted
following the defined syntax rules are simply not considered as part of the
data tree and they are still accessible as account data entries.

Introduction of standard utilities to manage the data tree will provide
an incentive to comply with the proposed semantic.

## Reference utilities

JavaScript:

* **Repository:** https://github.com/MisterTicot/stellar-draft-0005
* **Minimal implementation:**
  [flat.js](https://github.com/MisterTicot/stellar-draft-0005/blob/master/flat.js)
  parse account data entries as a list of keys. It takes 45Â lines of code so
  it's nice for being compact.
* **Recommended implementation:**
  [tree.js](https://github.com/MisterTicot/stellar-draft-0005/blob/master/tree.js),
  parse account data entries as a tree. It takes 70 lines of code. It is not
  as compact and efficient, but it is dev-friendly.

Both implementations expose the following methods:

* `accountData.read(account, [convert])` parse valid namespace entries from
  **account** and convert them to the desired format.
* `accountData.write(account, accountData)` generate a transaction that change
  **account** data entries to reflect **accountData**.
